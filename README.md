> A curation of my favoute moments from Boiler Room.

## Getting Started

### Installing Node 8.11.3 (LTS)

We use 8.11.3 for this project. First install NVM from here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation

Once you've got NVM setup, switch to 8.11.3:

```bash
# install the correct version
$ nvm install

# use the correct version
$ nvm use
```

### Installing NPM Dependencies

Now we're ready to install our node modules. Yarn is recommended.

```bash
# install yarn
$ npm i -g yarn

# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn start

# run unit tests
$ yarn test

# build project for production
$ yarn build
```
